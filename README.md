# The Nuvolos example gallery

This repository contains working examples for applications on the Nuvolos platform. Examples are organized first by topic, then by programming language. Currently we have examples in the 

 - R 
 - Python

 languages. Each example comes with their own respective `README.md` file that details dependencies that need to be installed and application compatibility.

## How to use

In order to use this example gallery, from any application open your terminal and execute the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/nuvolos-cloud/examples.git
```

An `example` folder will appear in your current working directory and you will see all examples in this directory structure. You can review the readme files from the File UI in Nuvolos and then start working with the code.
